38. We would like to understand 3 different levels of customers based on the amount associated with their purchases. The top branch includes anyone with a Lifetime Value (total sales of all orders) greater than 200,000 usd. The second branch is between 200,000 and 100,000 usd. The lowest branch is anyone under 100,000 usd. Provide a table that includes the level associated with each account. You should provide the account name, the total sales of all orders for the customer, and the level. Order with the top spending customers listed first.

SELECT  a.name acct, SUM(total_amt_usd) amt,
CASE WHEN SUM(o.total_amt_usd) > 200000 THEN 'top'
	 WHEN SUM(o.total_amt_usd) < 100000 THEN 'low'
ELSE 'middle'
END AS level
FROM orders o
JOIN accounts a
ON a.id = o.account_id 
GROUP BY acct
ORDER BY amt DESC

39. We would now like to perform a similar calculation to the first, but we want to obtain the total amount spent by customers only in 2016 and 2017. Keep the same levels as in the previous question. Order with the top spending customers listed first.

SELECT  a.name acct, SUM(total_amt_usd) amt,
CASE WHEN SUM(o.total_amt_usd) > 200000 THEN 'top'
	 WHEN SUM(o.total_amt_usd) < 100000 THEN 'low'
ELSE 'middle'
END AS level
FROM orders o
JOIN accounts a
ON a.id = o.account_id 
WHERE o.occurred_at > '2015-12-31' 
GROUP BY acct
ORDER BY amt DESC

40. The previous didn't account for the middle, nor the dollar amount associated with the sales. Management decides they want to see these characteristics represented as well. We would like to identify top performing sales reps, which are sales reps associated with more than 200 orders or more than 750000 in total sales. The middle group has any rep with more than 150 orders or 500000 in sales. Create a table with the sales rep name, the total number of orders, total sales across all orders, and a column with top, middle, or low depending on this criteria. Place the top sales people based on dollar amount of sales first in your final table. 

SELECT s.name sales_rep_name, 
COUNT(o.id) num_orders, 
SUM(total_amt_usd) dollar_sales,
CASE WHEN COUNT(o.id) > 200 OR 
	      SUM(total_amt_usd) > 750000 THEN 'top'
     WHEN COUNT(o.id) > 150 OR 
	      SUM(total_amt_usd) > 500000 THEN 'middle'
	 ELSE 'not'
END as level
FROM orders o
JOIN accounts a
ON o.account_id = a.id
JOIN sales_reps s 
ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
GROUP BY s.name
ORDER BY dollar_sales DESC
