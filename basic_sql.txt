1. Use LIMIT to only get the first 15 rows and include the occurred_at, account_id, and channel fields in the web_events table.

SELECT occurred_at, account_id, channel
FROM web_events
LIMIT 15;

2. practice using ORDER BY:

Write a query that returns the top 10 rows from orders ordered according to oldest to newest, but with the smallest total_amt_usd for each date listed first for each date.

SELECT *
FROM orders
ORDER BY occurred_at, total_amt_usd
LIMIT 10;

4. Use WHERE.

Pull the first 10 rows and all columns from the orders table that have a total_amt_usd less than 500.

SELECT * 
FROM ORDERS
WHERE total_amt_usd < 500
LIMIT 10

5. WHERE non-numeric

Filter the accounts table to include the company name, website, and the primary point of contact (primary_poc) for Exxon Mobil in the accounts table.

SELECT name, website, primary_poc 
FROM ACCOUNTS 
WHERE name = 'Exxon Mobil';


6. Use arithmetic operators

Write a query that finds the percentage of revenue that comes from poster paper for each order. 

SELECT id, account_id, 
poster_amt_usd/(standard_amt_usd + gloss_amt_usd + poster_amt_usd) AS post_per
FROM orders;

7. Use wild character

All companies whose names contain the string 'one' somewhere in the name.

SELECT name
FROM accounts
WHERE name LIKE '%one%';

8. USe IN

Use the web_events table to find all information regarding individuals who were contacted via the channel of organic or adwords.

SELECT * 
FROM web_events 
WHERE channel IN ('organic', 'adwords')

9. Use NOT

Use the web_events table to find all information regarding individuals who were contacted via any method except using organic or adwords methods.

SELECT * 
FROM web_events
WHERE channel
NOT IN ('organic', 'adwords')

10. Use AND and BETWEEN

Using the accounts table find all the companies whose names do not start with 'C' and end with 's'

SELECT name
FROM accounts
WHERE name NOT LIKE 'C%' AND name LIKE '%s';

11. Use OR

Find all the company names that start with a 'C' or 'W', and the primary contact contains 'ana' or 'Ana', but it doesn't contain 'eana'.

SELECT name 
FROM accounts
WHERE name LIKE ('C%') OR name LIKE ('W%')
AND
primary_poc LIKE ('%ana%') AND primary_poc LIKE ('%Ana%') AND primary_poc NOT LIKE ('%eana%')
