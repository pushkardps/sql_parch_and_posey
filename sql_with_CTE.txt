ORDER BY t1.std DESC
LIMIT 1)

SELECT * FROM t2
JOIN t1
ON t1.total >= t2.total
ORDER BY t1.total DESC

4. For the customer that spent the most (in total over their lifetime as a customer) total_amt_usd, how many web_events did they have for each channel?

WITH t1 as (SELECT a.name account
			FROM orders o
			JOIN accounts a
				ON o.account_id = a.id
			JOIN web_events w 
                ON w.account_id = a.id
			GROUP BY account
			ORDER BY SUM(total_amt_usd) DESC 
			LIMIT 1)
,
t2 as ( SELECT a.name account, w.channel, COUNT(*) events
FROM orders o
JOIN accounts a
ON o.account_id = a.id
JOIN web_events w 
ON w.account_id = a.id
GROUP BY account, w.channel
ORDER BY 3 DESC)

SELECT * 
FROM t2
JOIN t1
ON t1.account = t2.account


5.What is the lifetime average amount spent in terms of total_amt_usd for the top 10 total spending accounts?

WITH t1 as (SELECT a.name account, SUM(total_amt_usd) avgg
			FROM orders o
			JOIN accounts a
				ON a.id = o.account_id
			GROUP BY account
			ORDER BY 2 DESC
			LIMIT 10)

SELECT AVG(t1.avgg) lifetime_avgg
FROM t1

6.What is the lifetime average amount spent in terms of total_amt_usd for only the companies that spent more than the average of all accounts.

WITH t1 as (SELECT AVG(total_amt_usd)
FROM accounts a
JOIN orders o
ON a.id = o.account_id) 
,
t2 as (SELECT a.name, AVG(total_amt_usd) avgg 
       FROM accounts a
	   JOIN orders o
	   ON a.id = o.account_id
       GROUP BY a.name
       HAVING AVG(total_amt_usd) > (SELECT * FROM t1))
                                    
SELECT AVG(t2.avgg) life_avgg FROM t2
