1. The average amount of standard paper, gloss paper, poster paper sold on the first month that any order was placed in the orders table (in terms of quantity). Also display total amount spent during the same time.

SELECT AVG(standard_qty) as avg_std_qty,
       AVG(gloss_qty) as avg_gloss_qty,
       AVG(poster_qty) as avg_poster_qty,
       SUM(total_amt_usd) as tot_spent
FROM orders
WHERE DATE_TRUNC('month', occurred_at) = 
	 (SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', MIN(occurred_at)) 		  	  FROM orders) 

2. Provide the name of the sales_rep in each region with the largest amount of total_amt_usd sales.


SELECT t3.rep, t3.region, t3.tot_sales
FROM (  SELECT s.name rep, r.name region, 				     	SUM(o.total_amt_usd) tot_sales
	FROM orders o
	JOIN accounts a
		ON a.id = o.account_id
	JOIN sales_reps s
		ON s.id = a.sales_rep_id
	JOIN region r
		ON r.id = s.region_id
      	GROUP BY region, rep
      	ORDER BY region, tot_sales DESC) t3

JOIN (  SELECT region, Max(tot_sales) max_tot
		FROM (SELECT s.name rep, r.name region, 					SUM(o.total_amt_usd) tot_sales
		      FROM orders o
		      JOIN accounts a
				ON a.id = o.account_id
		      JOIN sales_reps s
				ON s.id = a.sales_rep_id
		      JOIN region r
				ON r.id = s.region_id
      		      GROUP BY region, rep
      	   	      ORDER BY region, tot_sales DESC) as t1
		GROUP BY t1.region) t2
ON t3.region = t2.region AND
   t3.tot_sales = t2.max_tot

ORDER BY t3.tot_sales DESC

Alternative way:

SELECT s.name rep, r.name region, 		                  SUM(total_amt_usd) tot
		FROM orders o
		JOIN accounts a
			ON o.account_id = a.id
		JOIN sales_reps s
			ON s.id = a.sales_rep_id
		JOIN region r
			ON s.region_id = r.id
		
        GROUP BY rep,region
HAVING  SUM(total_amt_usd) IN (	SELECT MAX(tot) max_tot
 				FROM ( SELECT s.name rep, 					  r.name region,               				SUM(total_amt_usd) tot
					FROM orders o
					JOIN accounts a
					ON o.account_id = a.id
					JOIN sales_reps s
					ON s.id = 								a.sales_rep_id
					JOIN region r
					ON s.region_id = r.id
					GROUP BY rep,region
					ORDER BY region, tot 				     DESC) as t1 
 				GROUP BY t1.region
			        ) 
ORDER BY tot DESC


3. For the region with the largest (sum) of sales total_amt_usd, how many total (count) orders were placed? 

SELECT t2.region, t2.num_orders, t2.tot_sales
FROM (SELECT r.name region, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) tot_sales,
          		COUNT(*) num_orders
      FROM orders o
      JOIN accounts a
	ON a.id = o.account_id
      JOIN sales_reps s
	ON s.id = a.sales_rep_id
      JOIN region r
	ON r.id = s.region_id
GROUP BY region
ORDER BY tot_sales DESC) t2

WHERE (t2.tot_sales) =  

(SELECT MAX(tot_sales) 
 FROM  (SELECT  r.name region, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) tot_sales
	FROM orders o
	JOIN accounts a
		ON a.id = o.account_id
	JOIN sales_reps s
		ON s.id = a.sales_rep_id
	JOIN region r
	        ON r.id = s.region_id
      	GROUP BY region
      	ORDER BY tot_sales DESC
    	LIMIT 1) as t1)

4.For the name of the account that purchased the most (in total over their lifetime as a customer) standard_qty paper, how many accounts still had more in total purchases? 

SELECT a.name account, SUM(standard_qty) tot_std,
       SUM(total) total   
FROM accounts a
JOIN orders o
	ON a.id = o.account_id
GROUP BY account

HAVING SUM(total) > (SELECT t1.total
		  	FROM	(SELECT a.name account, 		                       		SUM(standard_qty) 					tot_std,
                      	   		SUM(total) total   
				  FROM accounts a
				  JOIN orders o
				  ON a.id = o.account_id
				  GROUP BY account
				  ORDER BY tot_std DESC
 				  LIMIT 1) t1)
ORDER BY tot_std DESC

5.For the customer that spent the most (in total over their lifetime as a customer) total_amt_usd, how many web_events did they have for each channel?

SELECT a.name account, w.channel channel, COUNT(*) events
FROM accounts a
JOIN web_events w
ON a.id = w.account_id
WHERE a.name LIKE (SELECT t1.account
FROM ( SELECT a.name account, SUM(total_amt_usd) 	             tot_usd
		FROM accounts a
		JOIN orders o
			ON a.id = o.account_id
		GROUP BY account
		ORDER BY tot_usd DESC
		LIMIT 1) as t1)
GROUP BY account, channel
ORDER BY account, events DESC

6.What is the lifetime average amount spent in terms of total_amt_usd for the top 10 total spending accounts?

SELECT AVG(t1.tot_spent)
FROM ( SELECT a.id, a.name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) 			tot_spent
		FROM orders o
		JOIN accounts a
		ON a.id = o.account_id
		GROUP BY a.id, a.name
		ORDER BY 3 DESC
		LIMIT 10) as t1

7. What is the lifetime average amount spent in terms of total_amt_usd for only the companies that spent more than the average of all orders.

SELECT AVG(t1.avg_tot)
FROM (SELECT a.name account, AVG(o.total_amt_usd) avg_tot
		FROM orders o
		JOIN accounts a
			ON a.id = o.account_id	
		GROUP BY 1
		HAVING AVG(o.total_amt_usd)  > 
		
               (SELECT AVG(o.total_amt_usd) avg_tot
    		FROM orders o
		JOIN accounts a
		ON a.id = o.account_id))t1
