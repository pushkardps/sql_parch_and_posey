33. Find the sales in terms of total dollars for all orders in each year, ordered from greatest to least. Do you notice any trends in the yearly sales totals?


 SELECT DATE_PART('year', occurred_at) ord_year,  SUM(total_amt_usd) total_spent
 FROM orders
 GROUP BY 1
 ORDER BY 2 DESC;

34.Which month did Parch & Posey have the greatest sales in terms of total dollars? Are all months evenly represented by the dataset?

In order for this to be 'fair', we should remove the sales from 2013 and 2017. 

SELECT DATE_PART('month', occurred_at) ord_month, SUM(total_amt_usd) total_spent
FROM orders
WHERE occurred_at BETWEEN '2014-01-01' AND '2017-01-01'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;

The greatest sales amounts occur in December (12). 

35. Which year did Parch & Posey have the greatest sales in terms of total number of orders? Are all years evenly represented by the dataset?

SELECT DATE_PART('year', occurred_at) ord_year,  COUNT(*) total_sales
FROM orders
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;

Again, 2016 by far has the most amount of orders, but again 2013 and 2017 are not evenly represented to the other years in the dataset.

36.Which month did Parch & Posey have the greatest sales in terms of total number of orders? Are all months evenly represented by the dataset?

SELECT DATE_PART('month', occurred_at) ord_month, COUNT(*) total_sales
FROM orders
WHERE occurred_at BETWEEN '2014-01-01' AND '2017-01-01'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;

37. In which month of which year did Walmart spend the most on gloss paper in terms of dollars?

SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', o.occurred_at) ord_date, SUM(o.gloss_amt_usd) tot_spent
FROM orders o 
JOIN accounts a
ON a.id = o.account_id
WHERE a.name = 'Walmart'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 1;

May 2016 was when Walmart spent the most on gloss paper.
